## Social Media App

This project is a simple social media platform inspired by Facebook, developed to learn and showcase how to build a complete social media app using modern technologies. The backend is built with Node.js, using MongoDB for database management. The REST API handles essential features like user authentication (sign-up, log-in), and full CRUD operations for posts, users, and comments.

The frontend of the application is developed using React.js, leveraging functional components and React Hooks to create an interactive user interface. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in building a real-world social media application from scratch, covering both backend API development and frontend design.

## Social Media App

## Description

This is an ongoing project where I'm developing a social media web application as a hobby. The backend is being built using JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, with API testing and development handled through Postman. Future plans include developing the front end using React to create a fully functional and responsive user interface.
